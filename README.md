ðŸŒ± Before transitioning to software engineering, I worked as a user experience designer, where I led cross-functional teams to translate research insights into actionable product improvements. This background continues to inform my work today as I remain dedicated to designing accessible and user-friendly interfaces for AI/LLM toolsâ€”an essential step toward broader adoption and understanding of these technologies.

ðŸ’»I thrive on driving impact through software engineering, product development, and user experience design. I'm always open to discussing exciting projects or opportunities. Currently, I'm exploring roles in the US and would love to connect with anyone willing to take a chance on me. Feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d be happy to chat!
