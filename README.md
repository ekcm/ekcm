ðŸŒ± Hi, I'm Elijah! I'm a software engineer passionate about solving complex problems using large language models (LLMs). I specialize in building multi-agent workflows, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, and implementing full-stack LLM features in real-world scenarios. My work has given me a deep understanding of how to harness the power of LLMs to create impactful, innovative solutions.

ðŸ’» Before transitioning to software engineering, I worked as a user experience designer, where I led cross-functional teams to translate research insights into actionable product improvements. This background continues to inform my work today as I remain dedicated to designing accessible and user-friendly interfaces for AI/LLM toolsâ€”an essential step toward broader adoption and understanding of these technologies.

ðŸš€ I thrive on driving impact through software engineering, product development, and user experience design. I'm always open to discussing exciting projects or opportunities. Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijah-khor/)!
